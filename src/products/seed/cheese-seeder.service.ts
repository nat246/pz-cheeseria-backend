        description: `Barricato al Pepe cheese is produced by Sergio, the renowned maker of SottocenereÂ®. This pasteurized cow's milk cheese hails from Veneto, Italy. The term "Barricato" refers to the unique ageing process involving barrels. After 90-day ageing, the wheels are encrusted with black pepper and carefully stored in wine barrels for the final maturation phase. The addition of black peppercorns imparts a lively kick to the cheese without overshadowing its buttery texture. The traces of wine residue from the barrels contribute a subtle fruity note, resulting in a well-rounded and full flavour profile.`,

        description: `Geitost, also known as Brunost or Gjetost, is a cheese typically made with whey, milk, and/or cream. The cheese stands out due to its unique caramelized flavour. Geitost is made from a combination of cow's milk and goat's milk, or purely from goat's milk. The production process involves slowly simmering the milk, which causes the sugars to caramelize, giving the cheese its distinctive sweet and slightly tangy taste. The result is a dense, fudgy texture with pale caramel to deep brown colour. This cheese can be eaten on bread or crackers. It can also be paired with apples or pears.`,

The addition of Annatto imparts a warm sunrise colour to the cheese. The maturation process takes approximately 12 weeks, resulting in a cheese with delightful, grassy, and piquant flavours. This traditional British cheese offers an earthy complexity and a lingering subtleness. For a perfect pairing, enjoy it with fresh fruit or a crisp sparkling cider.`,
